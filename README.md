# NLPReadings

I decide to create a list of resources for a wide range of NLP and NLP-related topics. The aim is to include resources that explore topics in significant depth and do no just give superficial explanations and/or software implementations in a popular framework.

## Sequence Labeling
Intuitively, sequence labeling is the task of assigning a label to every token of a sequence. The most popular NLP tasks in this category are **Part-of-Speech** (POS) tagging, where the task at hand is to assign a POS to every token (i.e. word) in a sentence, and **Named Entity Recognition** (NER), where the task at hand is to decide whether a given token in an sentence is a named entity, and if so, what named entity (e.g. person, organization, location etc.).
